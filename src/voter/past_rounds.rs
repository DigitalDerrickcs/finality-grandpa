//! Rounds that are not the current best round are run in the background.
//!
//! This module provides utilities for managing those rounds and producing commit
//! messages from them. Any rounds that become irrelevant are dropped.
//!
//! Create a `PastRounds` struct, and drive it to completion while:
//!   - Informing it of any new finalized block heights
//!   - Passing it any validated commits (so backgrounded rounds don't produce conflicting ones)
